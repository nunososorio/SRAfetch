# SRAfetch: A Streamlit App for Fetching SRA Files

SRAfetch is a simple web app built with Streamlit that allows you to download SRA files from the NCBI SRA database. With SRAfetch, you can easily search for SRR IDs, explore their metadata using the SRA-tools software, and download the corresponding SRA files from the NCBI SRA website. SRAfetch is designed to make the process of fetching SRA files quick and easy, so you can focus on your research instead of dealing with complex command-line tools.

## Features

- Search for SRR IDs using a simple text input
- Explore SRR metadata using the SRA-tools software
- Download SRA files from the NCBI SRA website
- View the output of the `vdb-dump` command for each SRR ID
- Download the output of the `vdb-dump` command as a text file
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Getting Started

To use SRAfetch, simply visit the app's URL (TBD) and enter one or more SRR IDs in the text input. The app will display information about each SRR file and provide a link to download the corresponding SRA file from the NCBI SRA website.

## Developing and Extending SRAfetch

SRAfetch is built with Streamlit, a Python library for creating web apps. The app's source code is available on GitHub, so you can easily fork the repository and modify it to suit your needs.

To develop and extend SRAfetch, you will need to have the SRA-tools software installed on your system. You can install SRA-tools using a package manager like `conda` or `pip`, or you can download it from the NCBI website.

SRAfetch is designed to be easy to extend and customize. You can add new features, modify the user interface, or integrate the app with other tools and services. We welcome contributions from the community, so if you have ideas or suggestions for improving SRAfetch, please let us know!

## Supporting SRAfetch
